# Analysis of notated music

This repo brings together a set of algorithms for the analysis of notated music. The algorithms are based on the Music21 toolbox. They were developed as part of the PolyMIR project and its extensions.

- Cadence analysis*
- Root analysis*
- Real bass progression analysis
- Rhythm analysis


Algorithms followed by * make use of neural networks.The models are available in the Nakala archive.Updates after further training cycles are planned. 

This is work in progress. Repo documentation will be released soon.
